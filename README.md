Dextroncoin turning imagination into reality
=====================================

What is Dextroncoin?
----------------

DextronCoin is a virtual digital currency built on a private Blockchain Technology with a decentralized Wallet which enable users transfer in form of peer-peer without restrictions. DextronCoin is a utility and equity Coin built for the purpose of trading, gaming and solutions to data-base management. DextronCoin can be transferred within seconds to anytime with minimal or zero transaction charge. The total supply of DextronCoin is limited in supply; there will be a total of 30,000,000 DextronCoin in circulation.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Dextroncoin Core software, see https://dextroncoin.info, or read the
[original whitepaper](dextroncoin.info/whitepaper).

Testing
-------
Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
